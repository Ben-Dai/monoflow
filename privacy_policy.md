# MONOFLOW PRIVACY POLICY

**Effective Date: February 19, 2026**

MonoFlow ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the MonoFlow application (the "App").

## 1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

MonoFlow is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:

**a) User-Provided API Key**  
If you choose to use the built-in AI assistant feature, you must provide your own API key for a supported third-party AI service. This key is stored locally on your device using the macOS Keychain and is never transmitted to any server operated by us.

**b) Diagram Data**  
All flowchart and diagram data you create is stored locally on your device as JSON files. We do not collect, access, transmit, or store your diagram data on any external server.

**c) AI Conversations**  
When you use the AI assistant feature, your messages, diagram content (nodes, connections, labels), and any files you attach are sent directly from your device to the third-party AI service provider's API (e.g., Google Gemini) using your personal API key. These communications occur between your device and the provider's servers only. We do not operate any intermediary server, proxy, or relay. We do not have access to your conversations.

## 2. INFORMATION WE DO NOT COLLECT

- We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number.
- We do not use analytics, tracking, or telemetry of any kind.
- We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.
- We do not collect device identifiers, IP addresses, or usage statistics.
- We do not display advertisements.

## 3. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The AI assistant feature connects directly to third-party AI service providers. We do not operate any intermediary server. Your use of these services is subject to each provider's own privacy policy and terms of service. Below is a non-exhaustive list of providers the App may support:

**a) Google Gemini API**  
Google's use of data sent to the Gemini API is governed by Google's privacy policy and terms of service (https://policies.google.com/privacy).

**b) OpenAI API**  
OpenAI's use of data sent to its API is governed by OpenAI's privacy policy and terms of service (https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy).

**c) Anthropic API**  
Anthropic's use of data sent to its API is governed by Anthropic's privacy policy and terms of service (https://www.anthropic.com/privacy).

**d) Other Providers**  
We may add support for additional AI service providers in the future. When you choose to use any provider, your data is sent directly from your device to that provider's servers using your personal API key. We encourage you to review each provider's privacy policy before use.

## 4. DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY

- All data remains on your device. We do not operate any cloud storage, user accounts, or remote databases.
- Your API key(s) are stored in the macOS Keychain, which provides hardware-level encryption.
- The App runs within the macOS App Sandbox, limiting file access to user-selected locations only.
- Network access is used solely to communicate with your chosen third-party AI service provider when you explicitly initiate an AI chat.

## 5. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

MonoFlow does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect personal information from any user, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations.

## 6. DATA RETENTION

Since we do not collect or store user data on our servers, there is no data retention policy applicable to us. Your local files are entirely under your control.

## 7. YOUR RIGHTS

Because all data stays on your device:
- You can delete your diagram files at any time by removing them from your file system.
- You can remove your API key at any time through the App's settings.
- You can uninstall the App at any time, which will remove all App-related data from your device.

## 8. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this document. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
